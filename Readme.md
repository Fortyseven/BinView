# Binalysis

## Overview

This is a fork of [Russlan's](https://github.com/russlank) [BinView](https://github.com/russlank/BinView)
binary visualization prototype.

Combing through the BinView source helped me understand what was going on when
I was struggling with the basic idea. (Now it makes sense. ;))

I went through and restructured the code, commenting as I went along. I also
cleaned up the UI a bit, and hope to add some more features to aid in binary
analysis. (Or the 'clever' new name is all for nothing, after all.)

I'll expand this document later, as necessary.
